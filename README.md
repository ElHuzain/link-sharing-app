## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is Devlinks, my second completion for a GURU challenge in Frontend mentor :D
The web application provides a way for developers to share their social links easily.

For a quick peak, here's the [live version hosted at Vercel](https://elhuzain-devlinks.vercel.app).

## The challenge

NOTE: This is the challenge description from Frontend Mentor:

Your challenge is to build out this link-sharing app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Create, read, update, delete links and see previews in the mobile mockup
- Receive validations if the links form is submitted without a URL or with the wrong URL pattern for the platform
- Drag and drop links to reorder them
- Add profile details like profile picture, first name, last name, and email
- Receive validations if the profile details form is saved with no first or last name
- Preview their devlinks profile and copy the link to their clipboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)

## Approach

To satisfy the required functionality, I started by selecting components needed.

### Backend

- Firebase Authentication for user authentication
- Firebase' Firestore to store user data
- Firebase' Storage to store user images

### Client-side application

- Nextjs
- Chadcn-ui for UI elements
- Redux for state management
- React-hook-toast for toast messages

## Installation

To install the project
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/ElHuzain/link-sharing-app.git`
2. Run development environment using `npm run dev`, or build using `npm run build`.
